# GoWrench
GoWrench is a platform that makes life easier for developers and companies by offering a simple and efficient solution to solve common problems without the need to write repetitive code. The key feature is the use of YAML files, allowing for quick, clear, and flexible configuration and customization of services and APIs. This saves time and resources, enabling you to focus on what truly matters: delivering value and innovation.

The application will be packaged as a Docker image, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability, making it even easier to integrate into any development environment.
